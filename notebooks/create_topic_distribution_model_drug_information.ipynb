       "0  Acnesol Gel is an antibiotic that fights bacteria. It is used to treat acne, which appears as spots or pimples on your face, chest or back. This medicine works by attacking the bacteria that cause these pimples.Acnesol Gel is only meant for external use and should be used as advised by your doctor. You should normally wash and dry the affected area before applying a thin layer of the medicine. It should not be applied to broken or damaged skin. Avoid any contact with your eyes, nose, or mouth. Rinse it off with water if you accidentally get it in these areas. It may take several weeks for your symptoms to improve, but you should keep using this medicine regularly. Do not stop using it as soon as your acne starts to get better. Ask your doctor when you should stop treatment.Common side effects like minor itching, burning, or redness of the skin and oily skin may be seen in some people. These are usually temporary and resolve on their own. Consult your doctor if they bother you or do not go away.It is a safe medicine, but you should inform your doctor if you have any problems with your bowels (intestines). Also, inform the doctor if you have ever had bloody diarrhea caused by taking antibiotics or if you are using any other medicines to treat skin conditions. Consult your doctor about using this medicine if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.   \n",

It works by thinning and loosens mucus in the nose, windpipe and lungs and make it easier to cough out.Ambrodil Syrup should be taken with food. For better results, it is suggested to take it at the same time every day.  The dose and how often you take it depends on what you are taking it for. Your doctor will decide how much you need to improve your symptoms.  It is advised not to use it for more than 14 days without doctor consultation.The most common side effects of this medicine include vomiting, nausea, and stomach upset. Talk to your doctor if you are worried about side effects or they would not go away. Generally, it is advised not to take alcohol while on treatment.Before taking this medicine, tell your doctor if you have liver or kidney disease or if you have stomach problems. Your doctor should also know about all other medicines you are taking as many of these may make this medicine less effective or change the way it works. You must take doctor's advice before using this medicine if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.   \n",

This medicine works by attacking the bacteria that cause these pimples.Acnesol Gel is only meant for external use and should be used as advised by your doctor. You should normally wash and dry the affected area before applying a thin layer of the medicine. It should not be applied to broken or damaged skin. Avoid any contact with your eyes, nose, or mouth. Rinse it off with water if you accidentally get it in these areas. It may take several weeks for your symptoms to improve, but you should keep using this medicine regularly. Do not stop using it as soon as your acne starts to get better. Ask your doctor when you should stop treatment.Common side effects like minor itching, burning, or redness of the skin and oily skin may be seen in some people. These are usually temporary and resolve on their own. Consult your doctor if they bother you or do not go away.It is a safe medicine, but you should inform your doctor if you have any problems with your bowels (intestines). Also, inform the doctor if you have ever had bloody diarrhea caused by taking antibiotics or if you are using any other medicines to treat skin conditions. Consult your doctor about using this medicine if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.</td>\n",

       "0  Acnesol Gel is an antibiotic that fights bacteria. It is used to treat acne, which appears as spots or pimples on your face, chest or back. This medicine works by attacking the bacteria that cause these pimples.Acnesol Gel is only meant for external use and should be used as advised by your doctor. You should normally wash and dry the affected area before applying a thin layer of the medicine. It should not be applied to broken or damaged skin. Avoid any contact with your eyes, nose, or mouth. Rinse it off with water if you accidentally get it in these areas. It may take several weeks for your symptoms to improve, but you should keep using this medicine regularly. Do not stop using it as soon as your acne starts to get better. Ask your doctor when you should stop treatment.Common side effects like minor itching, burning, or redness of the skin and oily skin may be seen in some people. These are usually temporary and resolve on their own. Consult your doctor if they bother you or do not go away.It is a safe medicine, but you should inform your doctor if you have any problems with your bowels (intestines). Also, inform the doctor if you have ever had bloody diarrhea caused by taking antibiotics or if you are using any other medicines to treat skin conditions. Consult your doctor about using this medicine if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.   \n",

It is used to treat infections of the lungs (e.g., pneumonia), ear, nasal sinus, urinary tract, skin and soft tissue. It will not work for viral infections such as the common cold.Augmentin 625 Duo Tablet is best taken with a meal to reduce the chance of a stomach upset. You should take it regularly at evenly spaced intervals as per the schedule prescribed by your doctor. Taking it at the same time every day will help you to remember to take it. The dose will depend on what you are being treated for, but you should always complete a full course of this antibiotic as prescribed by your doctor. Do not stop taking it until you have finished, even when you feel better. If you stop taking it early, some bacteria may survive and the infection may come back or worsen.The most common side effects of this medicine include vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea. These are usually mild but let your doctor know if they bother you or will not go away.Before taking it, let your doctor know if you are allergic to any antibiotics or have any kidney or liver problems.

       "      <td>Angispan - TR 2.5mg Capsule is used to treat and prevent heart-related chest pain (angina). Angina occurs when the heart muscle is not getting enough blood. This medicine works by relaxing and widening blood vessels so blood can flow more easily to the heart.Angispan - TR 2.5mg Capsule should be taken in the dose and duration as advised by your doctor. It may be taken with or without food, preferably at a fixed time each day. Do not consume more than the recommended dose, as this may have harmful effects on your body. You can develop tolerance to this medicine over time, which means that the same dose becomes less effective. You have to stick to a really specific dosing schedule to prevent this from happening.The most common side effect of this medicine is headache which may be severe. This can sometimes be helped by drinking plenty of fluids and avoiding alcohol. You may also experience lightheadedness, which could increase your risk of having a fall. There are other, rarer side effects, some of them serious. Ask your doctor and read the leaflet which comes with the medicine to make sure you are keeping safe.Do not use Angispan - TR 2.5mg Capsule if you are taking medicines to treat high blood pressure in your lungs (pulmonary hypertension), erectile dysfunction or if you have anemia or glaucoma (increased pressure inside the eye). Always tell your doctor what other health conditions you have and what other medicines you are taking. It is best not to drink alcohol with this medicine as it increases some of the side effects.
